			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Assmilation has received a major update! remove: Kill, Maroon and Protect objectives have been removed from the mode.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Powers have been reorganized and are now unlocked in batches every five vessels. This gives hosts more power from the get-go and gives them distinct phases due to each batch affecting a specific area of the host's ability.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The psychic link pinpointer now starts off with very little time for hosts and must be strengthened by using Network Invasion. Each time a host is detected via NI, they can be tracked for an extra 30 seconds, and every successful use of NI increases the duration of all tracking by 10 seconds. A successful use of a new power, Reclaim, also increases the duration of all tracking by 30 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">This means that without generous use of Network Invasion and Reclaim, hivemind hosts will lose their radar before Security does.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Four new powers have been added!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reclaim is an early-game ability that instantly kills critically injured hosts that are adjacent, and reduces all power requirements by five vessels for each host reclaimed, instantly unlocking your next set of powers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Psychoreception is an early-game ability that gives you the approximate distance of anybody currently tracking you and any hosts you've previously detected via Network Invasion.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Chaos Induction is a mid-game power with a single use that turns four random vessels into antagonists with a single, customizable objective.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Circadian Shift is a late-game power that sends everybody in sight to sleep for up to almost a minute. The more people affected, the less time it lasts, the minimum being eight seconds. remove: Mass Assimilation has been removed as Reclaim now fills its role.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Assimilate Vessel and Release Vessel's cooldown have been reduced to 5 seconds to reduce waiting time between assimilation attempts.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bruteforce is no longer temporary, but immobilizes the user for five seconds after assimilation.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hive Sight also lets you hear what the vessel does.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The antag limit has been upped from 6 to 9</li>
				<li class="code_imp">A lot of internal changes to how Assimilation works. In summary, Assimilation now affects the mind instead of the mob, meaning that players will stay assimilated in a few more scenarios, most notably after death.</li>
				<li class="balance">Induce Panic and Distortion Field have been buffed to be more reliable, especially at lower hive sizes.</li>
				<li class="balance">Induce Panic and Circadian Shift can affect silicons but no longer affect hivemind hosts. experimental: A new endgame has been added. The One Mind that survives this ordeal will show the world the true terror of the word Hivemind.</li>

This will reveal semi-random bit of their past conversations, their intent, and their true name. You also get the antenna sprite. Can only be unlocked by combining Paranoia and Antenna.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">New system in genetics: Conflicting mutations. Some mutations will not allow others to activate.

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Reverts back to the bubblegum before [#38306](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/38306), was an unfinished pr and generally this bubblegum has more stuff to work with.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Enrage mode, while in this mode bubblegum is colored a deep red, moves faster, doesn't retreat, and is immune to projectiles. All while throwing out ground slam attacks around him that throw people around.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Clones, basically fake bubblegums that do one attack and disappear afterwards.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ground slam attack, only happens when bubblegum is enraged, throws enemies around. Beware being thrown into a wall or you might be stunned because this is how throws work in this game.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bubblegum can now continue to charge through enemies without stopping.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Bubblegum's anger modifier no longer determines his movement speed, instead having a constant speed and changing on enragement.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Blood spray is now a directional move and can move diagonally towards its target</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bubblegums charge no longer uses throws to calculate being hit.</li>
				<li class="balance">Bubblegum now retreats in his standard phase while not using moves, generally he was hard to get hit by in this phase anyways so this is a much smarter play on his part.</li>
				<li class="balance">Blood spray can now move through walls and goes further, this was pretty easily cheesed because it couldn't move through walls with just hugging the edges of walls and just made him too hard to balance.</li>
				<li class="balance">Bubblegum now procs melee checks much more often, though he has the same cooldown for his melee attacks. This means you're much less likely to stand next to him and not get hit.</li>
				<li class="balance">Bubblegum now charges 2 tiles past you, makes it slightly more difficult to predict where he's going to go and makes it so he can catch up to you easier.</li>
				<li class="balance">Bubblegum now moves faster during his charge.</li>
				<li class="balance">Bubblegum now only takes 50 damage from explosions, taking many bombs to kill him instead of just 10.</li>
